THINGS TO DO


IMMEDIATE TODO:

        
    make a human player
        curses interface through the programplayer
        
        curses thing mostly works, change to deque for the printing, and
        make sure to remove all of the other print statements that are floating around 
        in gameplayer
        
        
        also add human player injection to the reset database file,
        and make a script that launches games from the command line, and save them when complete
        
        
        


    change submission to allow more files
    
    
    change the hitsperguess calculation
