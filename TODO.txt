THINGS TO DO


make an update dealy, check the media/startinggate for new submissions
        scripts will be in there in folders, with description files
                with a description and author
    if there are any new fellas, verify
    
    also, run games
    
    
to do that:
    need to save to database with the new games, and upon a new submission
    

    
    
    
generate output:
    either make static web pages, or serve the pages with SQLAlchemy somehow????
    use jinja to make the html pages
