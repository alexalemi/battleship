            <h3>Battleship Tournament</h3>

<p>A dirt simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)">battleship</a> tournament engine.</p>

<p>The engine expects the processes to communicate over a socket.
When the engine runs your process, it will send a single 
command line argument, which is the port on which you should connect
to.</p>

<p>At that point, the engine will randomly determine who goes first,
and send each program a message on stdin,</p>

<pre>
0, opponent_name\n
</pre>

<p>where the first character tells whether you go first (0) or second (1),
and the second string is your opponents name.</p>

<p>Each binary must then report an ascii representation of a 10x10 game board
with: </p>

<pre>
A for the aircraft carrier (length 5),
B for a battle ship (length 4)
S for a submarine (length 3)
D for a destroyer (length 3)
P for a patrol boat (length 2)
0 for an empty square
</pre>

<p>
for example, an example board would be:
</p>

<pre>
0000000000\n
00000000PP\n
00B0000000\n
00B000A000\n
00B000ASSS\n
00BDDDA000\n
000000A000\n
000000A000\n
0000000000\n
0000000000\n
</pre>

<p>At that point, if it is your turn, you must report your guess
as a comma separated tuple, 0-indexed, e.g.</p>

<pre>
0, 5\n
</pre>

<p>The engine will report back on the socket, either <tt>H\n</tt> if a hit,
<tt>M\n</tt> if a miss, <tt>SX\n</tt> if you sunk a ship, where X is one of the 
boat characters above, and <tt>W\n</tt> if you won the game.</p>

<p>If it is not your turn, the engine will notify you of 
your opponents guess in the form a comma separated tuple</p>

<pre>
0, 5\n
</pre>

<p>or, if you just lost, you will recieve a single <tt>L\n</tt>:</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>if you are running this locally, it uses the following external packages:</p>
    
<ul>
 <li> <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures">futures</a>  (e.g. <tt>pip install futures</tt>)</li>
 <li> <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/trueskill/0.4.3">trueskill</a> - if you want to generate rankings</li>
 <li> <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">jinja2</a> - if you want to generate the webpages</li>
</ul>
